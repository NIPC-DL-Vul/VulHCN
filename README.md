# VulHCN
This page includes the code and data used in the paper Focus More on the Small Stuff: Hierarchical Attention-based Capsule Network for Robust Vulnerability Detection.

Contributions
1. We propose a novel greedy vulnerability-sensitive keywords selection approach to pinpoint highly suspicious vulnerable snippets and LLVM intermediate code-based representations to extract multi-dimensional and in-depth program features.
2. We design and implement an automatic detection framework VulHCN, a hierarchical attention-based capsule network for vulnerability detection.
3. We prepare a dataset of 57842 functions, including 21662 vulnerable functions and 36280 non-vulnerable functions. These vulnerabilities are from collected from SARD and NVD.
